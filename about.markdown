# About Our School

Gladstone High School’s staff prepares every student to successfully enter college and a career. We start with an one-on-one orientation for all incoming freshmen during which they are paired with their Link Leader, an upper classman mentor. Our counselors personalize a learning plan for each student.

Our school works closely with parents. Two parent conferences are scheduled a year for all parents to dialog with their children’s teachers. Parents volunteer in a number of ways, and serve on advisory committees such as Site Council and are active in athletic and music booster clubs. All parents are encouraged to participate.

Our college preparatory curriculum offers an even more rigorous academic challenge through honors courses. Advanced Placement in Calculus AB, Calculus BC, Spanish Language and Culture, Spanish Literature and Culture, World History, U.S. History, English Literature and Composition, Studio Art, English Language and Composition, U.S. Government, and Biology. For students wanting the excitement of academic competition, the Academic Decathlon team competes against other high schools in L.A. County.

Gladstone is proud to offer a comprehensive visual and performing arts curriculum in art, design, drama, band, jazz ensemble, concert choir and show choir. Two student drama productions are staged annually. Electives include Spanish, Spanish for the Spanish Speaker, French, American Sign Language, Forensics, Administration of Justice, business courses, fashion and culinary arts, auto mechanics, computer aided drafting, leadership, athletics and an award-winning activities program.

We are pleased to offer the new Gladstone Medical Pathway for preparation in the health care industry and medical professions. Students completing the pathway will qualify for the Medical Assistant certification prior to graduation.
