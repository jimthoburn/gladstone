# Attendance

*All Students:* Please be aware if you are absent from school or a class, you have only *5 days to clear that absence* in the Attendance Office. Phone calls go home every day if you have been absent. This time line is per district policy.

*Please be prepared to show your identification when picking up your child from school. Our goal is to ensure the safety of all students and their families.*
